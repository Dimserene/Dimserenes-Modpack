# 7thbeatcards
A mod for Balatro that adds several 7th Beat Games inspired cards.

This mod is still in early beta. You can dowload the beta [here](https://github.com/Joglacraft/7thbeatcards/tree/beta).

This mod **requies** [Talisman](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Talisman) v2.0.0 or above to work.

If you wish to contribute to this project via adding your own joker, spectral or tarot card ideas, you can add your entry [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DZ_vYWqw2_jNrWjUKC7JhycU2g71GZHh53U7sYoiIoY/edit?usp=sharing). Only thing I ask is to use common sense and to make sure your suggestion is a reference to 7th Beat Games.
