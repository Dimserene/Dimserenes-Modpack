![alt text](joker.png)

The Circus comes to town! Visit the circus and be amazed by the finely-tuned machine of gravity-defying artists
and tear-jerking buffoonery. Enjoy snacks; and visit the sideshow, gamble your chips away!

The Circus extends the regular Balatro gameplay with 30 new jokers (1 of them legendary), 1 new deck and 1 new boss.
