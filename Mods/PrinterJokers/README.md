This mod introduces a fun and unique experience by adding Printer Jokers. Printer Jokers are a special type of joker that, when played, allow players to "print" the joker it represents.

Along with the new jokers, the mod includes a variety of decks which lets you test out every Printer Joker.

Currently there are 13 printer jokers with their own decks, 1 normal joker, 1 new enhancement, 1 new tarot card and a new consumable types!
